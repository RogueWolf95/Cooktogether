Part 1: List the Ingredients for 2 servings
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

Part 2: Write concise Instructions
1. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.
2. Add in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until well combined.
4. Divide the dough in half and shape each portion into a disk. Wrap them in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until firm.
5. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.
6. On a lightly floured surface, roll out one portion of the dough to about 1/4 inch thickness. Use cookie cutters to cut out desired shapes and place them onto the prepared baking sheets.
7. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.
8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 with the remaining portion of dough.
9. Once the cookies are completely cooled, you can decorate them with icing or sprinkles if desired.
