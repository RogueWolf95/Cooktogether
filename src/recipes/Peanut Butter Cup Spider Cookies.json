    "name": "Peanut Butter Cup Spider Cookies",
    "ingredients": [
        "1 cup creamy peanut butter",
        "1/2 cup granulated sugar",
        "1/2 cup packed brown sugar",
        "1 egg",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "24 miniature peanut butter cups, unwrapped",
        "48 candy eyes",
        "48 small pretzel sticks"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "1. Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
        "2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the creamy peanut butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, egg, and vanilla extract. Mix until well combined and the mixture forms a dough.",
        "3. Roll the dough into small balls, about 1 tablespoon each. Place the dough balls onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between them. Press down lightly to slightly flatten each cookie.",
        "4. Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Remove from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes.",
        "5. While the cookies are still warm, gently press a miniature peanut butter cup into the center of each cookie. The heat of the cookies will slightly melt the peanut butter cup and help it stick in place.",
        "6. Let the cookies cool completely on a wire rack. As they cool, the peanut butter cup will solidify again.",
        "7. Once the cookies have cooled completely, use a small amount of peanut butter or melted chocolate to stick two candy eyes onto each peanut butter cup. These will represent the spider's eyes.",
        "8. Break each pretzel stick in half and gently press four pieces into each cookie, two on each side of the peanut butter cup. These will represent the spider's legs.",
        "9. Serve and enjoy!"
