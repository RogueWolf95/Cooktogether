Step 1: In a small bowl, combine the chopped mint leaves, olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to create a marinade.

Step 2: Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag and pour the marinade over them. Make sure the chicken is evenly coated with the marinade. Seal the bag and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight for maximum flavor.

Step 3: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.

Step 4: Remove the chicken breasts from the marinade and let any excess marinade drip off. Discard the remaining marinade.
