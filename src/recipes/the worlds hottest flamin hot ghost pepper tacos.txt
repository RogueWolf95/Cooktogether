Part 1: List the Ingredients for a serving count of 2

- 4 ghost peppers
- 1 lb ground beef or chicken
- 1 onion, finely chopped

Part 2: Write the concise Instructions

1. Start by handling the ghost peppers with caution. Wearing gloves, remove the stems and mince the peppers. Set aside.
2. In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, sautéing until they are softened and slightly browned.
3. Add the ground beef or chicken to the skillet and cook until browned and cooked through.
4. Sprinkle in the cumin powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Stir well to incorporate all the spices.
5. Add the minced ghost peppers to the skillet and stir. Be careful not to inhale the fumes as they can be very spicy.
6. Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for another 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
7. In the meantime, warm the flour tortillas in a separate skillet or microwave them for a few seconds until they are pliable.
8. Assemble the tacos by placing a spoonful of the beef or chicken mixture onto each tortilla.
